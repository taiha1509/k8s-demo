Pod:
    Smallest unit of k8s
    Abstraction over container
    Usually 1 application per Pod
    Each Pos gets its own IP address to communicate
    Replica delployment

Deployment:
    Abstraction over Pod
    Blueprint for create Pod

Service:
    Permanent IP address
    Lifecycle of Pod and Service NOT connected
    Also act as load balancer

Ingress:
    Forward request to service
    use domain name instead of IP address

Config Map:
    external configuration of application
    similar with .env file
    don't push credential here

Secret:
    use to store secret data
    store in base64 encoded

Volumns:
    storage on local mechine or remote
    K8s doesn't manage data persistent

Namespace
    Clust inside cluster
    Don't need in small project
    usecase:
        Many team, same application, avoid conflict delployment
        Resouce sharing: 
            staging and development
            Blue/green Deployment
        Access and resource limits on Namespaces
    Charateristic:
        You can't access most resources from another namespace
        Can access service in another namespace
        Some components which can't be created within a namespace:
            Volumn, Node
        By default, components are created in default namespace
    Change active namespace: use kubectx tool ('default' is active namespace)

K8s Architecture

    Master node
        4 process run:
            API Server:
                cluster gateway
                authentication, validate request
            Scheduler:
                schedule new Pod
                just decide on which Node new Pod should be scheduled (base on some metrics such as RAM, CPU,...)
            Controller manager:
                detects cluster state changes
                call Scheduler to create a new Pod
            etcd:
                cluster brain
                key value store
        multi-master mode

    Node
        has multiple Pods
        Worker node do the actual works
        must has Kubelet and Container runtime (Docker), Kubelet Proxy
        Kubelet:

Minikube:
    create virtual box on laptop
    for testing purpose

Kubeclt:
    Command line tool for k8s


Kubeclt command:
